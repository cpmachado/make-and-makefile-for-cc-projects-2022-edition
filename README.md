# make-and-makefile-for-cc-projects-2022-edition

My code through "Master Make and Makefile for C/C++ Projects" by Jan Schaffranek.

Core differences:
- Repository structure and conventions
- My notes and personal solution mirroring the rules implemented by the author.
- My better template is basically the same as my default template
